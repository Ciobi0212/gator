   cd gator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. Set up the database (make sure PostgreSQL is running):
   ```bash
   # Install goose for migrations
   go install github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@latest
   
   # Run migrations
   goose -dir sql/schema postgres "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/gator_db?sslmode=disable" up
   ```

4. Build the application:

   go build -o gator
   ```

## Quick Start

1. **Register a new user:**
   ```bash
   ./gator register john
   ```

2. **Add an RSS feed:**
   ```bash
   ./gator addfeed "Hacker News" https://news.ycombinator.com/rss
   ```

3. **Start the aggregator in the background:**
   ```bash
   ./gator agg 30m 5 &
   ```
   This will fetch new content every 30 minutes with 5 concurrent workers.

4. **Browse the latest posts:**

## Example Workflow

Here's a complete workflow example:

./gator register sarah

# Add some tech news feeds
./gator addfeed "Hacker News" https://news.ycombinator.com/rss
./gator addfeed "The Verge" https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml
./gator addfeed "Wired" https://www.wired.com/feed/rss

# Start aggregating content in the background (every 15 minutes with 3 concurrent workers)
./gator agg 15m 3 &

# Check what feeds you're following
./gator following

# Browse the 15 most recent posts
./gator browse 15

# Stop following a feed
./gator unfollow https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml
```

## Tips & Tricks

- Run `./gator agg` in a separate terminal window or as a background process to continuously fetch new content
- For faster updates with many feeds, increase the concurrency parameter (e.g., `./gator agg 10m 10`)
- Use `./gator help` to see all available commands
- Set up a cronjob to run the aggregator automatically at system startup

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with certain feeds not parsing correctly, try these solutions:

1. Verify the feed URL is correct and accessible
2. Check that the feed is a valid RSS format
